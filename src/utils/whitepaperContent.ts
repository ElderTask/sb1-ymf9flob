      title: "Technical Architecture",
      content: `PAVE implements a revolutionary multi-layer architecture that combines the best aspects of existing blockchain systems with cutting-edge innovations:

1. Base Layer (Consensus)
- Novel Hybrid Consensus combining Proof of Stake with Byzantine Fault Tolerance
- Dynamic validator selection using reputation scoring
- Parallel transaction processing with cross-shard communication
- Theoretical throughput of 100,000+ TPS

2. Execution Layer
- WebAssembly-based smart contract runtime
- Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation for optimal performance
- Native support for multiple programming languages
- Deterministic execution environment

3. Data Layer
- Advanced data sharding with dynamic reallocation
- Zero-knowledge rollups for data compression
- Distributed storage with redundancy
- Efficient state management using Merkle Patricia Trees`

      title: "Security Model",
      content: `PAVE's security architecture implements multiple layers of protection:

1. Cryptographic Security
- Post-quantum cryptographic primitives
- Multi-signature schemes with threshold signatures
- Zero-knowledge proofs for transaction privacy
- Homomorphic encryption for sensitive computations

2. Network Security
- Sybil attack resistance through stake-weighted participation
- Eclipse attack prevention using diverse peer selection
- DDoS protection with rate limiting and reputation systems
- Secure validator rotation with unpredictable selection

3. Smart Contract Security
- Formal verification of critical contracts

      title: "Economic Model",
      content: `The PAVE token economy is designed for long-term sustainability and network health:

1. Token Utility
- Transaction fee payments
- Validator staking
- Governance participation
- Protocol service payments

2. Staking Mechanics
- Minimum stake requirement: 10,000 PAVE

- Slashing conditions for malicious behavior
- Delegation system for smaller holders

3. Fee Structure
- Dynamic fee adjustment based on network usage
- Fee burning mechanism for deflation
- Revenue sharing with validators
- Separate fee markets for different services`
